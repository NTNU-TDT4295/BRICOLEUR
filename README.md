# BRICOLEUR

This is the collision detection group's final submission for the course TDT4295 Computer Design Project 2018. This course aims to give students an introduction to the process of designing physical computer solutions, from start to finish. The project was completed on a budget of 10000 NOK, of which 5400 NOK were spent. 

## What is BRICOLEUR?
A bricoleur is someone who starts building something with no clear plan, adding bits here and there, cobbling together a whole while flying by the seat of their pants.
